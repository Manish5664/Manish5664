<div id="col1"><h1> Gaganyaan</h1>
<p>November 23, 2022</p>

<p>The primary mandate of HSFC is to spearhead ISRO's Gaganyaan programme through co-ordinated efforts and focus all the activities that are carried out in other ISRO centres, research labs in India, Indian academia and Industries towards accomplishing the mission. HSFC, as the lead Centre for Human space flight activities conforms to high standards of reliability and human safety in undertaking R&D activities in new technology areas, such as life support systems, Human Factors Engineering, Bioastronautics, Crew training and Human rating & certification. These areas would constitute important components for future sustained human space flight activities like rendezvous and docking, space station building and interplanetary collaborative manned missions to Moon/Mars and near-earth asteroids.</p>


<h3>Gaganyaan</h3>

<p>Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters.</p>

<p>The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience of Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with cutting edge technologies available with international agencies. The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying crew safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, crew emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and rehabilitation of crew.</p>

<p>Various precursor missions are planned for demonstrating the Technology Preparedness Levels before carrying out the actual Human Space Flight mission. These demonstrator missions include Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT), Pad Abort Test (PAT) and Test Vehicle (TV) flights. Safety and reliability of all systems will be proven in unmanned missions preceding manned mission.</p>

<a name="Human rated LVM3 - HLVM3">

<h3>Human rated LVM3 - HLVM3</h3>

<img src="image/lvm.jpg" style="width:20%;">

<p>LVM3 rocket - The well proven and reliable heavy lift launcher of ISRO, is identified as the launch vehicle for Gaganyaan mission. It consists of solid stage, liquid stage and cryogenic stage. All systems in LVM3 launch vehicle are re-configured to meet human rating requirements and christened Human Rated LVM3. HLVM3 will be capable of launching the Orbital Module to an intended Low Earth Orbit of 400 km.</p>

<p>HLVM3 consists of Crew Escape System (CES) powered by a set of quick acting, high burn rate solid motors which ensures that Crew Module along with crew is taken to a safe distance in case of any emergency either at launch pad or during ascent phase.</p>


<h3>Orbital Module</h3>

<p>Orbital Module (OM) that will be Orbiting Earth comprises of Crew Module (CM) and Service Module (SM). OM is equipped with state-of-the-art avionics systems with adequate redundancy considering human safety.</p>

<p>CM is the habitable space with Earth like environment in space for the crew. It is of double walled construction consisting of pressurized metallic Inner Structure and unpressurised External Structure with Thermal Protection System (TPS). It houses the crew interfaces, human centric products, life support system, avionics and deceleration systems. It is also designed for re-entry to ensure safety of the crew during descent till touchdown.</p>

<p>SM will be used for providing necessary support to CM while in orbit. It is an unpressurized structure containing thermal system, propulsion system, power systems, avionics systems and deployment mechanisms.</p>


<h3>New technologies being developed for Gaganyaan</h3>

<p>Human safety is of paramount importance in Gaganyaan mission. In order to ensure the same, various new technologies comprising of Engineering systems and Human centric systems are being developed and realised.</p>

<a name="Gaganyaan Crew Module">

<h3>Gaganyaan Crew Module</h3>


<p>Gaganyaan crew module is a fully autonomous 5.3 t (12,000 lb) spacecraft designed to carry a 3-member crew to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to seven days.[1] The crew module is equipped with two parachutes for redundancy, with one parachute enough for a safe splashdown. The parachutes would reduce the speed of the crew module from over 216 m/s (480 mph) to under 11 m/s (25 mph) at splashdown.</p>

<p>The space capsule will have life support and environmental control systems. It will be equipped with emergency mission abort capabilities and a Crew Escape System (CES) that can be activated during the first stage or second rocket stage burn.[59] The nose of the original version of the orbital vehicle was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts.</p>

<p>Glavkosmos and Human Space Flight Centre signed a deal on October 2019 for Energia to equip the Gaganyaan crew with life support system and supply thermal control system for the spacecraft. In addition to supplying food, water, and oxygen and assisting in regulating body temperature, the life support system will also handle waste products of crew members. Throughout the mission, the thermal control system will maintain the spacecraft's component within permissible temperature limits.</p>

<p>The Human Space Flight Center and Glavkosmos signed a deal on 11 March 2020, for the manufacture and supply of individual equipment packages. NPP Zvezda will manufacture customized couch liners and individual seats for Indian astronauts as part of the contract.</p>

<p>Following fruitless attempts to obtain the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) from other countries, ISRO has declared that it will be developing it on its own for Gaganyaan mission. According to ISRO Chairman S Somanath, ISRO has no experience in producing ECLSS, but it was forced to urge national laboratories and domestic industry to begin developing the technology because there were no foreign partners available to share the technology.[64] The first orbiter module adaptor assembly (OMA) for Gaganyaan was provided by Kineco Kaman Composites on 23 December 2023. The OMA is a conical structure with a diameter of 4 meters, composed of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers. It is combined with the equipment bay shroud and crew escape module.</p>

<p>The Emergency Sea Water Purification Kit was developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation. The package provides astronauts with clean water during operations and emergencies by eliminating excessive levels of Total Dissolved Matter, turbidity, color, and microbiological contamination from sea water in 30 minutes. The user testing for the Gaganyaan mission at Bombay Dockyard was successfully completed in 2022.</p>

<p>In order to visit the International Space Station (ISS) and Bharatiya Antariksha Station in the future, ISRO intends to incorporate International Docking System Standard (IDSS) compatibility.</p>

<h3>Launch Vehicle</h3>

<p>Following three uncrewed orbital flight demonstrations of the spacecraft, a crewed Gaganyaan is slated to be launched on the HLVM3 (Human-rated version of LVM3) launcher.</p>

<p>While the LVM3 is being human rated for Gaganyaan project, the rocket was designed with potential human spaceflight applications in consideration. The maximum acceleration during ascent phase of flight was limited to 4 Gs for crew comfort and a 5-metre (16 ft) diameter payload fairing was used to be able to accommodate large modules like space station segments.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a number of changes to make safety-critical subsystems reliable are planned for lower operating margins, redundancy, stringent qualification requirements, revaluation and strengthening of components. Avionics improvements includes an Integrated Health Monitoring System (LVHM), Dual chain Telemetry & Telecommand Processor (TTCP) and Quad-redundant Navigation and Guidance Computer (NGC). The High Thrust Vikas engines (HTVE) of L110 core stage will operate at a chamber pressure of 58.5 bar instead of 62 bar and the Human rated S200 boosters (HS200) will operate at chamber pressure of 55.5 bar instead of 58.8 bar. Segment joints will have three O-rings each. Electro mechanical actuators and digital stage controllers will be employed in all stages of launch vehicle.</p>

<p>Gaganyaan's green propellant development was confirmed by K. Sivan, and it will be used in all stages of HLVM3. In order to stop rocket engines from emitting chlorinated exhaust products, ISRO has started the development of an environmentally benign solid propellant based on Glycidyl Azide Polymer (GAP) as fuel and Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) as oxidizer. Green propellant combinations including hydrogen peroxide, kerosene, liquid oxygen, liquid methane, ADN-methanol-water, ADN-glycerol-water are all part of the technology demonstration projects that ISRO is conducting. With the use of electric propulsion for spacecraft and the acceptance of liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen and LOX/kerosene based propulsion systems for launch vehicles, ISRO has already started the transition towards environmentally benign and green propellants. Currently in use in the cryogenic upper stages of the GSLV and LVM3 is the LOX/LH2 mix. In place of traditional hydrazine, ISRO developed ISROSENE, a rocket grade version of kerosene. In the South Asia satellite, ISRO has effectively proven an electric propulsion technology for station keeping operations.</p>

<p>Indian Astronauts Corps (2019 Batch) (L-R) Nair, Krishnan, Prathap and Shukla
On 27 February 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi revealed the identities of the first four Indian astronauts: Gp Capt Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Gp Capt Ajit Krishnan, Gp Capt Angad Prathap and Wg Cdr Shubanshu Shukla. From this group, two astronauts will train at NASA facilities in preparation for their participation in Axiom Mission 4 to the International Space Station (ISS) and later crewed space mission from India. Shubhanshu Shukla was selected by ISRO on 2 August 2024, to be a member of the Axiom Mission 4 prime crew, with Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair being disclosed as his backup. They have all served as test pilots for a long time and are wing commanders or group captains in the Indian Air Force (IAF).</p>

<h3>Ground uniform</h3>
<p>The ground uniforms were developed by the staff and students of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Bengaluru. Under the direction of the former NIFT director Susan Thomas, the NIFT team—which consisted of three students, Lamia Anees, Samarpan Pradhan, and Tuliya D—as well as two professors, Jonalee Bajpai and Mohan Kumar V—worked on designing the ground uniform for the Gaganyaan mission. The team highlighted the importance for the astronaut-designates' pockets to fit perfectly and the uniform must operate well in order to support their motions. Seventy possibilities were considered before the final design was chosen. The NIFT team examined various space agency uniforms, such as those from SpaceX and NASA. The theme that the NIFT team has explored is asymmetry. The group worked on a two-colored, asymmetrical style line. The design was commissioned in 2021 by the NIFT team, and in 2022, they handed the design to ISRO.</p>

<h3>Space suit</h3>
<p>According to G. Madhavan Nair, space suit development has already begun in a low-key manner prior to the official Cabinet approval of ₹9,023 crore Gaganyaan project on 28 December 2018. During the Bengaluru Space Expo 2018, ISRO unveiled the prototype space suit for the Gaganyaan mission. The orange colour prototype space suit was created at Thiruvananthapuram's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The lab began working on the prototype development from 2016. The prototype space suit weighs less than five kilograms and is constructed of four layers. One oxygen cylinder, sufficient for the astronaut to breathe for sixty minutes, can be accommodated in the suit. For the mission, ISRO has already created two suits and is currently working on the third one.</p>

<p>Chairman K. Sivan during an interview with India Today on 9 November 2018 stated that ISRO is continuing the research on spacesuits in order to enhance them. Glavkosmos has also contracted NPP Zvezda for manufacturing customized IVA flight-suits for Indian astronauts. Indian astronauts visited Zvezda on 3 September 2020, to have their anthropometric measurements taken in preparation for the creation of spacesuits later on. On 7 September 2020, Zvezda authorities announced that the organization had started manufacturing space suits for the Gaganyaan mission.</p>

<p>Hindustan Times reported on 12 January 2024, that in order to double-check crew safety for the first mission, Indian astronauts are expected to don Russian-made spacesuits rather than the domestically manufactured Intra Vehicular Activity (IVA) suits created by Vikram Sarabhai Space Center.</p>

<h3>Pressure suit</h3>
<p>In collaboration with Space Applications Centre, Sure Safety, an industrial safety equipment firm based in Vadodara, finished developing pressure suit for Gaganyaan mission called Astronaut Crew Escape Suit (ACES). The experiments conducted in vacuum chambers to test the material under laboratory settings are almost finished as of 18 January 2019, according to Nishith Dand, managing director of Sure Safety. The indigenously developed suit weighs 20% less while maintaining high standards of safety against fire, water, pressure changes and one hundredth of the cost of its foreign counterpart. In terms of life support, oxygen/air management, and CBRN resistance, the ACES will combine the finest features of the Russian Sokol and the American Advanced Crew Escape Suit. The ACES's communications, pressure management, oxygen and carbon monoxide sensors, and biosensors for sensing body temperatures have all been developed successfully. The suit features air diverters, utility pockets, touch screen-sensitive gloves, a flexible hood zipper, and lightweight shoes. The temperature range in which ACES can function is −40°C to +80°C. ACES development project helped Sure Safety became one of the few companies globally with the expertise to create and build these types of suits.</p>

<p>In the event of an environmental emergency within the space capsule, ACES will protect the crew. Its goal is to preserve the wearer's life in the event that the spacecraft unintentionally loses pressurization.</p>

<h3>SAKHI</h3>
<p>An all-purpose software called SAKHI (Space-borne Assistant and Knowledge Hub for Crew Interaction) created by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre will assist astronauts on the Gaganyaan space travel mission with a variety of duties, including interacting with one another and locating critical technical information. Among its many duties, SAKHI will closely monitor their health, sending data on vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. This information will be extremely helpful in determining the crew's physical state during the Gaganyaan mission. Ensuring a smooth communication link, SAKHI will maintain the crew's connection to the ground-based stations and the onboard computer. The app will also serve as a reminder for them regarding their sleep patterns, food regimen, and hydration levels. An engineering model of the specially designed, portable smart device with SAKHI has been successfully tested by the space facility. The process is ongoing for creating a flight approved, production ready model. Fastened to their space suits, the digital platform is always readily available. Additionally, the astronauts can report their journey using the app in a variety of formats, such as voice notes, texts, and photos.</p>

<h3>Vyommitra</h3>

<img src="image/vyom.jpeg" style="width:20%;">

<p>Vyommitra, a spacefaring humanoid robot
On 22 January 2020, ISRO announced Vyommitra, a female-looking robot who will accompany the other astronauts in the mission. ISRO aims not to fly animals onboard experimental missions unlike other nations that have carried out human space flight. Instead, it will fly humanoid robots for a better understanding of what weightlessness and radiation do to the human body during long durations in space.</p>

<p>Vyommitra is expected to be onboard uncrewed Gaganyaan missions to perform microgravity experiments, monitor module parameters, and support astronauts in crewed missions by simulating functions like a human from the waist up. It does not have legs. It is programmed to speak Hindi and English and perform multiple tasks.</p>

<p>It can detect and give out warnings if environmental changes within the cabin get uncomfortable to astronauts and change the air condition. It can autonomously complete tasks and follow new commands.</p>
